/**
 * The inbound management worker handles the receiving of heartbeats (network
 * status), job bidding, elections.
 * 
 * HB requests to this node are processed here. Nodes making a request to
 * receive heartbeats are in essence requesting to establish an edge (comm)
 * between two nodes. On failure, the connecter must initiate a reconnect - to
 * produce the heartbeatMgr.
 * 
 * On loss of connection: When a connection is lost, the emitter will not try to
 * establish the connection. The edge associated with the lost node is marked
 * failed and all outbound (enqueued) messages are dropped (TBD as we could
 * delay this action to allow the node to detect and re-establish the
 * connection).
 * 
 * Connections are bi-directional (reads and writes) at this time.
